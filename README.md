# InfectionModel
An general purpose infectious disease model for things that are spread 
just by passing by someone with it.

# Usage
    
    ./infection-model <simulation file>

A simulation is defined as an dosini file. You can see a heavily 
documented example file in `example-sim.ini`. Which defines everything the 
program would ever need to know about the simulation that you are running.
